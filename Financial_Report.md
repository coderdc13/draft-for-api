# Financial Report



In this section, you will compile a financial report to demo your calculations to the Consumer App Team. The report should be written as a markdown file and include the following sections:

Budget Analysis: Summarize the transaction data from the budget analysis and include images for each chart and table produced.

Retirement Planning: Summarize the retirement portfolio analysis and include the charts for the Monte Carlo simulation.

Optional Challenge â€” Early Retirement
Harold was really impressed with your work on this planner, but commented that 30 years seems like such a long time to wait to retire! Harold starts wondering if the retirement plan could be adjusted to retire earlier than normal. Try adjusting the portfolio to either include more risk (a higher stock than bond ratio) or to have a larger initial investment and rerun the retirement analysis to see what it would take to retire in 5 years instead of 30!

## Budget Analysis
From the table of expenses per category, it seems that expenditures of food and drink take a significant number of transactions. Directly below is the bar chart for expenditures by category.
